## Commit Conventions

A commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer, separated by a blank line.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

The type can be one of the following:
```
feat (feature)
fix (bug fix)
test (when adding missing tests)
chore (maintain)
```
